# React Tic Tac Toe

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using React. The game allows two players to take turns and compete to get three of their symbols (X or O) in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## Getting Started

To run the Tic Tac Toe game locally on your machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/shoaibhasann/React-Tic-Tac-Toe.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd React-Tic-Tac-Toe`
3. Install the required dependencies with `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

The game should now be accessible at `http://localhost:5173` in your web browser.

## How to Play

1. Open the game in your web browser.
2. You will see a 3x3 grid representing the Tic Tac Toe board.
3. Player 1 will start the game by clicking on an empty cell to place their "O."
4. Player 2 will then take their turn by clicking on an empty cell to place their "X."
5. The players will continue to take turns until one of them wins by getting three of their symbols in a row, or the game ends in a draw if the board is filled with no winner.

## Features

- Responsive design to ensure optimal display on various screen sizes.
- Reset button to start a new game after the game is over or to start over during an ongoing game.

## Technologies Used

- CSS: For styling the components.
